### Run your own assembly code!

1. Enter the assembly in the catalog/computer/asm directory in {file_name}.asm
2. Change the read file path in assembler.py to {file_name).asm
3. Change the write file path in assembler.py to {file_name}_exe
4. Run python3 assembler.py
5. Change the read file in tb_computer.sv to {file_name}_exe
6. Run make clean compile simulate to display the results

Note: You can view our ISA attached to the repository (16-bit_CPU_ISA.docx) to view valid assembly instructions.
